You have a vendor library which provides a class called "VendorAdder" which implements an "Adder" interface.
This interface has a method with the following signature

public interface Adder {
    public void add(int a, int b, AddCallBack callBack);
}

public interface AddCallBack {
    public void withResult(int result);
}

* The real implementation of the vendor performs the add computation and calls the AddCallBack object with the result
(the call back may or may not be in the same thread).

You are required to write a service that implements the following interface

public class AdditionService {

    public int add(int a, int b);
}

* The service will be instantiated each and every time so the idea is to be simple.

How would you test this?
